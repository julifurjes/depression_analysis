I used both a machine learning approach (Random Forest) and a statistical model (GEE) to find out which factors are most linked to depression at different time points. The data was balanced (using SMOTETomek) so there wasn’t an unfair advantage in predicting “no depression.”
    
-   **Random Forest Insights (All Times Combined):**  
    When considering all time points together, these were the top predictors:
    
    -   **eq5d5:** EQ-5D dimension related to anxiety/depression
    -   **hads7:** A HADS question often reflecting anxiety symptoms
    -   **score_eq5d:** Overall EQ-5D health score
    -   **hads5:** Another anxiety-related HADS item
    -   **hads1:** A HADS question typically tied to feeling tense or anxious
    -   **haqScore:** A summary measure from the HAQ, reflecting functional health
    -   **eq5d7:** Another EQ-5D dimension from the dataset
    -   **haq13:** A specific HAQ item
    -   **Pontuacao_Ansiedade:** An overall anxiety score
    -   **hads3:** Another HADS item indicating anxiety/depressive symptoms
-   **Random Forest Insights at Each Individual Time Point:**  
    Running the Random Forest separately at each time (T0, T1, T3) highlighted slightly different key factors:
    
    -   **At T0 (initial):**  
        Key predictors included **hads7 (anxiety)**, **score_eq5d (overall health)**, **eq5d7 (quality-of-life dimension)**, **Pont_Ansiedade (anxiety score)**, **hads5 (anxiety)**, **eq5d5 (anxiety/depression)**, **hads1 (tension/anxiety)**, **haqScore (functional health)**, **haq13 (HAQ item)**, and **haq20 (another HAQ item)**.
        
    -   **At T1 (first follow-up):**  
        Important factors were **score_eq5d**, **Pontuacao_Ansiedade**, **eq5d5**, **haqScore**, **hads1**, **haq13**, **eq5d7**, **hads5**, **hads3**, and **haq9**—again showing a blend of anxiety measures and quality-of-life assessments.
        
    -   **At T3 (later follow-up):**  
        Top features included **score_eq5d**, **Pontuacao_Ansiedade**, **eq5d5**, **hads5**, **eq5d6 (an EQ-5D dimension)**, **hads1**, **haqScore**, **haq18 (HAQ item)**, **hads3**, and **Tempo_Baixa_cod (a time-related variable)**. This again suggests a consistent role for anxiety and overall health quality even later on.
        
-   **GEE Model Insights (All Times Combined):**  
    The GEE model is a more traditional statistical test. It highlighted certain variables as significantly linked to depression status at different times.
    
    -   Across all data, anxiety-related items (like **hads7**, **hads1**, **hads5**), certain HAQ items (e.g., **haqScore**, **haq9**, **haq8**), presence of a mental health condition (**Doenca_Mental**), and certain EQ-5D dimensions (like **eq5d5**, **eq5d7**) came out as important in predicting depression.
-   **GEE Insights at Specific Times:**
    
    -   **At T0:** Significant factors included **hads7**, **haqScore**, **haq9**, **hads1**, **Doenca_Mental**, **score_eq5d**, **haq8**, and **eq5d7**.
    -   **At T1:** Notable variables were **haq13**, **hads1**, and **Pontuacao_Ansiedade**.
    -   **At T3:** Important predictors were **hads7**, **hads5**, **eq5d5**, **hads1**, **Doenca_Mental**, and **eq5d6**.
